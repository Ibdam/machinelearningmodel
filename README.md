OVERVIEW

The Advertising Model project aims to predict the success of an advertising campaign based on various features such as the amount spent on TV, radio, and newspaper ads. Using historical advertising data, this project trains and evaluates a machine learning model to predict the sales generated by different advertising strategies.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sales generated by an advertising campaign based on the budget allocated to TV, radio, and newspaper ads. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment.

FEATURES:

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature engineering and selection
Model training and hyperparameter tuning
Model evaluation and performance metrics
Deployment-ready code for prediction

Model Training
The model training script (train_model.py) handles the following tasks:

Load and preprocess the data
Split the data into training and testing sets
Train a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
Save the trained model to a file for later use
Evaluation
The model evaluation script (evaluate_model.py) computes performance metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared (RÂ²)
These metrics help in assessing the effectiveness of the trained model.
